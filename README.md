Capture the Crate
=================

It's a Dota 2 Addon created with the Dota 2 Workshop Tools Alpha.

The Addon is a Game Mode in which two teams need to capture a crate by picking it up and return it to their base. The game ends after a defined time or after one team captured the set amount of crates to their base. When the time runs out the team with the most captured crates wins.
